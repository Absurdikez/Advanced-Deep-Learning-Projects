After training it with **60 epochs**, we observed that the model provides slightly better accuracy on training set as it gives **96% on training set** and **29% on test set**. We noticed that computional time of training was very high(60 mins for 60 epochs).\n","\n","\n","## Comments on the impact of Data augmentation\n","\n","In this method, we used the same architecture as the previous method, but with more data augmentation.\n","\n","Data augmentation is a method used to improve the training accuracy of a model when dealing with small data sets. Even though we expected to make better results than first implementation by applying it, unfortunately that wasn't the case. We might missed something in the implementation of code. Result was **87% accuracy on training** set and **22% on test set** with **25** epochs.\n","\n","## Comments on transfer learning\n","In transfer learning, a machine exploits the knowledge gained from a previous task to improve generalization about another.\n","\n","Transfer learning provided **best** results(**96% acc. on training set and 29% test set**). this result is expected because the transfer learning framework is specially designed for the case of small data, and we have been able to prove that using it provides better results than training from scratch even if we have a large amount of labelled data.
